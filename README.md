PCB stands for "Printed Circuit Board." It is a board made of non-conductive material, such as fiberglass or plastic, on which conductive pathways are printed or etched. PCBs are commonly used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors, and microchips, in devices such as computers, smartphones, and televisions. PCBs are an essential part of modern electronics manufacturing, and they allow for compact, reliable, and cost-effective electronic devices.
Here,I design the PCB of Arduino_UNO using Autodesk_EAGLE having three main modules
1)POWER MODULE
2)MICROCONTROLLER MODULE
3)I/O PINS
