PCB stands for "Printed Circuit Board." It is a board made of non-conductive material, such as fiberglass or plastic, on which conductive pathways are printed or etched. PCBs are commonly used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components, such as resistors, capacitors, and microchips, in devices such as computers, smartphones, and televisions. PCBs are an essential part of modern electronics manufacturing, and they allow for compact, reliable, and cost-effective electronic devices.

Here,I design a PCB for Arduino_UNO using Autodesk_EAGLE software having three main modules.

1)POWER MODULE

2)MICROCONTROLLER MODULE

3)I/O PINS

In this repo I attached the background files related to the design.
